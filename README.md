# UssdAPI
This repository contains a simple USSD API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, leveraging the Africa's Talking USSD API for registering users via USSD. The USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) protocol allows users to interact with a mobile service provider's systems through a series of menu-based prompts.
